🧠 AI-Powered Data Analyst Workflow
Automated Insights with n8n, Google Gemini, MySQL & Telegram
________________________________________
🌟 Overview
This project brings data analytics to life by creating an AI Data Analyst Assistant that can chat, analyze, and respond intelligently to cricket statistics queries.
Using n8n automation, Google Gemini AI, and a MySQL database, the system:
•	💬 Interacts with users via chat
•	🗄️ Retrieves and analyzes real-time data
•	🧠 Generates insightful reports
•	📲 Notifies users instantly via Telegram
—all automatically.

🧩 Workflow Highlights
Step	Process	Description
💬 1	Chat Trigger	The interaction begins when the user sends a message to the chatbot — like chatting with a real data analyst.
🗄️ 2	SQL Query Execution	Connects to the MySQL database to fetch cricket batsmen statistics in real time.
🧠 3	AI Data Analysis	The Google Gemini model analyzes data patterns like top scorers and highest strike rates.
🧾 4	File Creation	Converts insights into a well-structured text report automatically.
💾 5	File Storage	Saves the generated report on the n8n server directory.
📲 6	Telegram Notification	Sends an instant Telegram message to notify users that the report is ready.

💡 Description:
This snapshot represents the automation process built in n8n, where each node handles a specific task such as triggering chat input, fetching data from MySQL, sending it to Google Gemini for AI analysis, saving the output file, and notifying the user via Telegram.
🔄 How It Works
1.	Start the Chat:
User greets the assistant and asks questions (e.g., “Who are the top three batsmen by strike rate?”).
2.	Database Connection:
The system connects to the MySQL database and retrieves cricket data.
3.	AI-Powered Analysis:
Google Gemini AI analyzes player performance and generates insights.
4.	Report Generation:
Results are formatted and saved as a .txt file.
5.	Instant Notification:
A Telegram message confirms report creation and provides the file location.
