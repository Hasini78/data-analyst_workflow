🧠 AI-Powered Data Analyst Workflow
Automated Insights with n8n, Google Gemini, MySQL & Telegram
________________________________________
🌟 Overview
This project brings data analytics to life by creating an AI Data Analyst Assistant that can chat, analyze, and respond intelligently to cricket statistics queries.
Using n8n automation, Google Gemini AI, and a MySQL database, the system interacts with users, retrieves data, performs insightful analysis, and finally notifies them through Telegram — all automatically.

🧩 Workflow Highlights
The entire process is designed as a seamless chain of intelligent automation:
•	💬 Chat Trigger: The conversation begins when a user sends a message to the chatbot. It provides a friendly interface that feels like chatting with a real analyst.
•	🗄️ SQL Query Execution: The workflow connects to the MySQL database and fetches real cricket batsmen statistics in real time.
•	🧠 AI Data Analysis: The data is processed through Google Gemini, which identifies key performance patterns such as top scorers and highest strike rates.
•	🧾 File Creation: Once the analysis is complete, the insights are neatly converted into a text report.
•	💾 File Storage: The generated report is stored safely in the n8n server directory for easy access.
•	📲 Telegram Notification: Finally, a message is sent through Telegram to notify the user that the analysis file is ready.
Each step works together in harmony to transform raw data into easy-to-understand AI insights.

🔄 How It Works
1.	Start the Chat
The user greets the assistant through a public chat link and asks a question, like “Who are the top three batsmen by strike rate?”
2.	Database Connection
The system instantly connects to the MySQL database and retrieves all relevant cricket data.
3.	AI-Powered Analysis
Google Gemini examines the retrieved data, compares player performance, and crafts meaningful insights in natural language.
4.	Report Generation
The output is converted into a well-formatted text report and saved on the server.
5.	Instant Notification
The user receives a Telegram message confirming the file creation and its location on the system.
